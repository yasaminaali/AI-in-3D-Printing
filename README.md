Flip_Transpose2.py: this file has codes for the two basic operation on Hamiltonian paths/cycles in a grid graph. It has the code for creating initial paths like "zigzag", "hilbert", "snake_bends", "fermat_spiral".
SA.py: this file contains the code for simulated annealing. 


TODO: create documentation for all the files.
